# String Manipulation Assignment

This project contains two tasks related to string manipulation in JavaScript.

## Task 1: Shuffle String

### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string.

### Example

```javascript
Input: s = "mamacode", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Output: "codemama"
```
# String Manipulation Assignment: Task 2

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

## Example

```javascript
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```
